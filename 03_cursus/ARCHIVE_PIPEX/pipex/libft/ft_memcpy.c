DESCRIPTION
Copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest. The data type dose not
matter, it can do this on any data type, because it copies byte by byte.
PARAMETERS
*dest ==>	pointer to where the bytes will be copied to
*src ==>	pointer from where the bytes are copied from
n ==>		nuber of bytes to be copied
RETURN
The pointer dest from the same position as it was passed into the function.
IMPLEMENTATION
-> the if condition checks if src and dest are not pointing to NULL or n is 0
-> loop as long the index is smaller then n, cast to a pointer of char and copy
-> by casting to a data type which is 1 byte in size, we can copy the same
data in memory even if the original data type is larger
NOTE
The memory areas must not overlap. Use memmove() for overlap.*/
