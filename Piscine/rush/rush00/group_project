# Group project Instructions

1. The program must compile with the following ﬂags: -Wall -Wextra -Werror; and
uses cc.  
2. If your program doesn’t compile, you’ll get 0.
3. Your program must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus
ﬁles/functions, they are included in the norm check and you will receive a 0 if there
is a norm error inside.
4. You will have to handle errors coherently. Feel free to either print an error message,
or simply return control to the user.
5. You must therefore do the project with the imposed team and show up at Your
defense slot, with all of your teammates.
6. You project must be done by the time you get to defense. The purpose of defense
is for you to present and explain your work.
7. Each member of your group must be fully aware of the works of the project. Should
you choose to split the workload, make sure you all understand what everybody’s
done. During the defense, you’ll be asked questions and the ﬁnal grade will be
based on the worst explanations.
8. If you want bonus points, you may submit other subjects or be able to use program
arguments to test your function.

## Submission and peer-evaluation

Turn in your assignment in your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your repos-
itory will be evaluated during the defense. Don’t hesitate to double check the names of
your ﬁles to ensure they are correct.
As these assignments are not veriﬁed by a program, feel free to organize your ﬁles as
you wish, as long as you turn in the mandatory ﬁles and comply with the requirements.

> You need to return only the files requested by the subject of this
project.
